updating during standup

However, a status update is a useful session for engineering managers and product managers to understand how everyone is handling their tasks and an opportunity for engineers to showcase their leadership abilities.

A status update is where you can showcase how well you manage ambiguity and is an important way to build trust with your team.
even if got nth to show, discuss what you did, mgrs want to hear what is the delta
if same spot as b4 mgr wants to udstd if you are waiting for resp for sm1 or info that is hard to find, the team wants to unblock u

if unable to self block ask for help in a concrete, direct way, indicate you have tried multiple ways to resolve it yourself

tips to make your standup more engaging
1. create short summary list before update
	1. list of what you did and what you will do, blockers
2. speak in layman's terms - prdt mgrs should also understand
3. include other commitments in yr status updates
4. explain why the work matters (need to make work relevant to others)
