As of my last update in September 2021, there isn't a widely recognized tool that allows you to subscribe to specific lines of code in a repository and trigger actions in your own repository when those lines change. However, the functionality you're describing could be built using a combination of existing tools and services. Here's a sketch of how you might accomplish it:

### Components Needed:

1. **Git Hook or Webhook for the Source Repository:** To notify you when changes are made.
    
2. **Script to Check for Specific Changes:** To scan changes and see if the lines you care about have been modified.
    
3. **Webhook for Your Own Repository:** To trigger whatever action you want to take.
    

### Steps:

1. **Monitor Source Repository**:
    - You could set up a webhook on the repository you want to monitor. This requires administrative access to the repo. If thatâ€™s not feasible, you can set up a service that frequently pulls the latest changes and scans for differences.
2. **Check for Changes in Specific Lines**:
    - When notified of a change, your service needs to scan the relevant file(s) to see if the lines you care about have been altered. This could be done using standard `diff` tools or custom logic.
3. **Trigger Your Repository's Actions**:
    - If your monitored lines have changed, you can trigger a webhook or API call to initiate some workflow in your own repository. You could accomplish this using CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or similar.

### Potential Tools and Services:

- **GitHub/GitLab API:** For programmatically interacting with repositories.
- **GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/CD:** For defining and running your workflows.
- **AWS Lambda or equivalent:** For running serverless functions that can execute your monitoring logic.

### Sample Flow:

1. **AWS Lambda (or similar) function is triggered on a schedule.**
2. **Lambda function uses GitHub API to pull the latest version of the monitored files.**
3. **Lambda function checks if the lines you care about have changed since last check.**
4. **If yes, Lambda function triggers GitHub Action in your repo using GitHub API.**

This is a somewhat complex setup and would require programming skills to implement, but it should be able to accomplish your goal.

Yes, you can conditionally run parts of your CI/CD pipeline based on changes to specific files, including files within a Git submodule. The specific method of implementation will vary depending on what CI/CD service you're using. Below are some generalized steps and then an example for using GitHub Actions:

### Generalized Steps:

1. **Checkout the Repository**: Your CI/CD pipeline should start by checking out the repository and its submodules.
    
2. **Detect Changes**: After that, you can use Git commands to check which files have changed. To do this for a submodule, you'll have to navigate into the submodule directory and run Git commands there.
    
3. **Run Conditionally**: Based on the output of the Git commands, you can conditionally decide which steps of your pipeline to execute.
    

### GitHub Actions Example:

Here's how you might implement such conditional running in GitHub Actions.

```
name: Conditionally Run Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        submodules: 'recursive'

    - name: Check for changes in submodule
      id: check_changes
      run: |
        cd your-submodule-dir
        git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.before }} ${{ github.sha }} > changed_files.txt
        echo "Changed files:"
        cat changed_files.txt
        if grep -q 'your-specific-file' changed_files.txt; then
          echo "Your specific file has changed!"
          echo "run_tests=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        else
          echo "Your specific file has NOT changed."
          echo "run_tests=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        fi

    - name: Run Tests
      if: env.run_tests == 'true'
      run: |
        echo "Running tests because your specific file changed."
        # Your test-running commands here

```
