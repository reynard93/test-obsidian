**Develop a clear understanding of the Stereotypical Architecture** 

Unless you know what you need to work towards, where concerns/responsibilities **stereotypically** belong, which **stereotypical patterns** you’ll need to use, and which **roles they stereotypically play**, it’s going to be hard for you to feel confident making design decisions.

_**How to Vet Libraries & Frameworks**_
_When you understand the stereotypical architecture, choosing which tools to use becomes a matter of **merely organizing Responsibilities** (RDD)._

_**How to Stub & Mock (Indirect Inputs & Outputs) —** We also talked about the idea that our Input-Output systems could **inject** within them other systems. This paves the way for Indirect Inputs and Indirect Outputs. We get deep into the topics of testing, mocking, stubbing and so on here. You can use this on the frontend or on the backend._
