And as software designers and strategic developers, it’s vital to begin to develop this awareness. Within each step of the **Purpose-Path-Action** process, we follow the 3 Step Essentialist Process.

We **Observe & Eval**, **Eliminate** and _**Execute**_.

_**We’ll be using this as we plan and execute strategies, designs, tests, and carve out architectures in pretty much everything within the program.**_

1. Mastery comes from a _**First Principles Understanding of Your Domain**_ and gives you the ability to identify and create _**Software as Value**_ capable of giving back time or enriching it (_Time-Given-Back_ or _Time-Enriched_).
2. **The Essential Properties of Success** for this program are **Philosophy** + **Attitude** + **Action** + **A Clear Goal**. You need a _**Clear Goal**_ to know what to mov towards, a great _**Attitude**_ to stay on the path, the correct skills & knowledge to take **Action**, and the right mental models (_Philosophy_) to make sense of your reality.
3. The key thing that separates a masterful developer from a non-masterful one is _**decisions**_. Mastery might seem like magic, but it’s really just one correct decision made after the next.
4. The **Purpose-Path-Action Process** is a mental model you can use to understand your decision-making process, because what we can understand and track, improves.
5. **Faulty decision-making processes** is what keep some developers stuck for years, never getting deeper towards the _**First Principles of Your Domain**_. This is what can cause it to take years to acquire levels of Mastery.
