yw y2w 2yw because cmds also takes cmd,cmd and numbers are optional

y2w and 2yw interchangeable

notice command and number always optional you can simply have a movement commands

C replace till end of line,
D same thing, difference is c goes insert mode d does not

~ is for changing case

x deletes a single character, X deletes before yr cursor

U restores line to pristine state

the insert commands just listed (plus `i` and `a`) take numeric prefixes. With numeric prefixes, you might use the commands `i`, `I`, `a`, and `A` to insert a row of underlines or alternating characters. For example, typing `50i*` ESC inserts 50 asterisks, and typing `25a*-` ESC appends 50 characters (25 pairs of asterisk and hyphen).
