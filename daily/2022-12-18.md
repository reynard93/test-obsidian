K to show hover documentation

yw y2w 2yw because cmds also takes cmd,cmd and numbers are optional

y2w and 2yw interchangeable

notice command and number always optional you can simply have a movement commands

C replace till end of line,
D same thing, difference is c goes insert mode d does not

~ is for changing case

x deletes a single character, X deletes before yr cursor

U restores line to pristine state

the insert commands just listed (plus `i` and `a`) take numeric prefixes. With numeric prefixes, you might use the commands `i`, `I`, `a`, and `A` to insert a row of underlines or alternating characters. For example, typing `50i*` ESC inserts 50 asterisks, and typing `25a*-` ESC appends 50 characters (25 pairs of asterisk and hyphen).

ea if u havent realised is good for apending text to a word 
delete single char use x, change multi chars use s

+ go first character of next line
- first char of prev line
6G go to line 6

c-e or c-y scroll up one line up/down can use f/b or d/u

read repositioning the screen with z

HML can position your cursor top midd btm

^ goes to first nonblank char on current line

{ move to begin /end paragraphs}

5} goes 5 para down -> you can combine number with movement

Changing through searching
You can combine the / and ? search operators with the commands that change text, such as c and d. Continuing with the previous example:

d?sometext

f/t use ;/, to find same-dir/bwd-dir, capitalised searches backwards
number prefix locates teh nth occurance
2f<r> 

c/d/y
c13G/d13G/y13G
