Here’s the main gist : **domain model should be kept separate from the dangers of the outside world, and interfaces are the bridges connecting the dots**. That’s also the basis for [Hexagonal Architecture](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/), [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), [Onion Architecture](https://www.codeguru.com/csharp/understanding-onion-architecture/), and all the other trademarked terms that more or less boil down to the same principles.

But Domain Driven Design takes it a step further and gives the tool to structure and develop the domain itself, **while the others architectures are just a mean to encapsulate the domain**. In other words, you can do Hexagonal without DDD, **but you can’t really do DDD without layers around**.

One shouldn’t use a complex tool for a trivial problem.

Transaction Scripts change to Active Record
	abstract away the db implementation details, problem now: logic dupe
	- more boilerplate, worth it if doing other processes as well

Activate the NERDTree and navigate to the directory in which the new file should live. Then press m to bring up the NERDTree Filesystem Menu and choose a for "add child node". Then simply enter the file's (or directory's name) and you're done.

gM			Like "g0", but to halfway the text of the line.
			With a count: to this percentage of text in the line.
			Thus "10gM" is near the start of the text and "90gM"
			is near the end of the text.
