a group can have multiple uen,
link btwn compasscroup and compassgroupcompany is by compassgroup.id
compassgroupcompany field for if isActive or not is by ExpirtyDate and EffectiveDate

there is already seed data

select * from osadmin.compassgroupCOMPANY;
						osadmin.compassgroup

select osadmin.lookupexternal where inttype ' "SSICIndex"

select  OSADMIN.SSICTOSECTORMAPPING

we store ssicIndex,  2010 code from rules
	reason why ssicIndex

on outsystem getssicbyssicindex

rules all along use ssic 2010

look at osadmin.ossys_entity where upper(name) = 'COMPANY'

select * from osadin.OSUSR_gn1_Company; -> ssic field here will become ssicIndex (ice cream scope)

osadmin.compassc1detail

get C1-c6 values, there is a getGroupSSIC

PP - preassesment , pat - preassessent tooll ->both will call comapssruels service
udner createApplicationHash is where fields are located

ICT stands for intra-corporate transfarees



constant.js from which place

-----

apply-form , map key to msg from en.json or renew-en.json

overall-texts.js - each keymap to a unique description

intermediate attb - an inferred attb (calc'd) which is not a top lvl goal and 
does prove another attb( it is used by another attb )

top lvl goal - inferred attb wh does not prove any other attb, most cases this the most impt attb, the key outcome

### forward chain
what can i conclude based on info i have? 
	info i have: base attb
	concluded: intermediate attb

### backward chain
what do i need to find out to prove this attb?
	this attb: intermediate attb
	what i need: base attb

### Rule
Each rule must:
	1. have a conclusion
	2. at least one condition

opa booleans- true / false / unknown / uncertain
unknown - data is missing,
