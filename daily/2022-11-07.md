compass_outsystem_manigest from bdlxas65

compassTest.osp goes to sit only
compass.osp goes all the way

if we change pat or pp will trigger rules pipeline, compass rules sytem is also included in rels otsystem manifest osp
if we look isndie we caqn see within it has compassRuleservice
for rules_outsystems_manifest it needs to bve triggered manually fom the comit log
idk about the pipeline choosing different versions, go and take a look

idk about the outsystem 176 version part

pipeline misc_rules to sync from dev to staging of various things

make sure the same manifest number is chosen when we bundle, there is a line that reads on rules-outsytem_manifest that says
MANIFEST BUILD: 279

2010 currently wins, ssic is always changed every 5 years
all rules written currently is for ssic 2010

wins we need to map to sector and description, changes every 5 years
look at the page for wcd/ssice+design
n to 1 mapping all map to one 2020 code

there is also 1 to n

ssoc is doing similar approach, they already have this ssoc thing
look at page SSIC Design

just replace with html check if okay, get all the styles out and inline the styles

checkout dtl.occupation table, need a new col for 2020 code? ignore ssocindex as it is for legacy use, look at id

apply employment table uses the id to indicate which occupation is used
ssic is waht is passed ro rules for processing
tkae note of occupation_casino from dtl too

i might have broke some stuff by accident too, which is behavior when fail should not show rest of results and other places using same component does not have the exapnd and hide functionality

use beforePrint and use @beforePrint event

assessment tool component need to conditionally not show the acordion 

i think can follow thru htd wqifw commits

look at outsystem module mqproducer

moving it there (design system) is so much more limiting, i want to be ble to set initial state too, i fi dont want to use the accoridon i can only ever duplicated?
