compass_outsystem_manigest from bdlxas65

compassTest.osp goes to sit only
compass.osp goes all the way

if we change pat or pp will trigger rules pipeline, compass rules sytem is also included in rels otsystem manifest osp
if we look isndie we caqn see within it has compassRuleservice
for rules_outsystems_manifest it needs to bve triggered manually fom the comit log
idk about the pipeline choosing different versions, go and take a look

idk about the outsystem 176 version part

pipeline misc_rules to sync from dev to staging of various things

make sure the same manifest number is chosen when we bundle, there is a line that reads on rules-outsytem_manifest that says
MANIFEST BUILD: 279

2010 currently wins, ssic is always changed every 5 years
all rules written currently is for ssic 2010

wins we need to map to sector and description, changes every 5 years
look at the page for wcd/ssice+design
n to 1 mapping all map to one 2020 code

there is also 1 to n

ssoc is doing similar approach
look at page SSIC Design
