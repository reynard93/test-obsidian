i think this is importatn:
![[Pasted image 20221103122603.png]]
on user-data/actions.js

priority is only to check for company uen how and when isea onbehajlf it sets company differently so that onbehalf can be triggered

if so isEaOnBehalf shoudl vbeh changes as well to isEAonbvEhalf for renew flow.l, routes the constnat name need to be mroe specific as well rename to ROUTEs.newq_ea_RENEW_transaction
think yih xsiang chaecked for the appeakl flow,.

if data still nto workign thfrit eha ea suer aslk ys for help too

---
if jauto states the think of quick-link with the ea user and behalf ed on client find out why it is nto wokring,. there is a valdiation when i reached hte summary saying aldiaiton failed, find hout why that is triggered

double confirm is not setting anything the wan select companies busineess

check what details this page is caused by and how to get the comapny./login user to have access riughts?

const validateDraft = async (_, appId) => {  
  try {  
    const response = await applicationApi.getDraft(appId)  
    const isValidated = response && response.results[0].validated

how is validated determined? - this is when
	Errors":["CurrentIssuedPass.CompanyCode <> Application.CompanyCode"]}}
this is coming from testos.coy when the companycode
at first i didnt add 00 behind and redis cached it i have to reset redis in order to work

![[Pasted image 20221103164752.png]]


another ifel for company profile - actual company
coy for application - applciaitojn tie to which ocmapny

insert wrongly without the 00 but forgot to update th db for that record

```sql
**UPDATE** TESTOS.COY

**SET** COMPANYCODE = 'SATHR0000100',

UEN = 'SATHR00001'

**WHERE** COMPANYCODE = 'SATEA0000100';```

three apis getting called see how they link together
