find default is current dir and print
	use -exec to execute a linux cmd for each file path
practical example: 
	- perform ls -l for .conf in /etc and its subdir:
		- find /etc -type f -name "*.conf*" -exec ls -l {} ";"
	- mass delete files thru a dir:
		- **find $HOME/tmp -type f -name "*~" -exec echo rm {} ";"** // remove echo to run it for real
	- have shortcut for those two: -ls and - delete
		- **find /etc -type f -name "*.conf" -ls**
		- **find $HOME/tmp -type f -name "*~" -delete**

awk '{print $2}' <file> = refer to any col by $<#>, use $NF to refer to the final field, entire line use $0, it does not print whitespace btwn vals by default, if u want separate by comma
	| awk '{print $1, $3}'
**awk 'FNR>1 {print $4}'** -> get only linenumber above 1
awk print is gr8 for o/p of cmds that strays outside tidy cols
If you encounter input separated by something other than space characters, `awk` can change its field separator to any regular expression with the `-F` option:
**echo efficient:::::linux | awk -F':*' '{print $2}**

`tac` is great for processing data that is already in chronological order but not reversible with the `sort -r` command. A typical case is reversing a web-server log file to process its lines from newest to oldest:

awk and sed are king
