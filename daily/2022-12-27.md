find default is current dir and print
	use -exec to execute a linux cmd for each file path
practical example: 
	- perform ls -l for .conf in /etc and its subdir:
		- find /etc -type f -name "*.conf*" -exec ls -l {} ";"
	- mass delete files thru a dir:
		- **find $HOME/tmp -type f -name "*~" -exec echo rm {} ";"** // remove echo to run it for real
	- have shortcut for those two: -ls and - delete
		- **find /etc -type f -name "*.conf" -ls**
		- **find $HOME/tmp -type f -name "*~" -delete**

go back watch primejean vim motions and install the new conf i found
