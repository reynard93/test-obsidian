different types of occupations i do the fitlering for all?
	just need go redis data helper and filter on new column

job ad lookup not getting from redis?

fail then show the whole breakdown, ea dont show button at all

ssoc is used to call pat (contrsuct payload to call it),
ssocindex is when you construct payload to call to mq(intranet)
diff: send to internet or intranet

choose oocupaiton also get from the same list

come to may can use job ads from more than 3 months ago,
currently only 14k
trying to reduce to only 8000

what euston and may yee are doing, add display of ssoc description

8k subset of 14k 

casino only can be selected by the two IRs, apply the same concept to casinos

do we want to keep

dont need to feature flag, as long as dont obsolete it will still appear
load also obsootled datetime to redis
then when readout 

if wsg return everyhtng that is loaded - descition then add one extra call to get occupations
if read from occupations - as you type, only return those 

note to do so for the casino side too
