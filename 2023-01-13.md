fix deprecations related to sat-form itself -> configureCompat ignore deprecations caused by assessment component,
note: there is per-compoennt config

compatConfig: { MODE: 3, // opt-in to Vue 3 behavior for this component only FEATURE_ID_A: true // features can also be toggled at component level }

when trying to run test encounter vue-jest error, today going to fix that

The "globals" property in the Jest configuration file allows you to specify global variables that should be available throughout your test files. The properties you define in this object will be added to the global scope, making them accessible to all tests.

install jest to fix the problem, but now got error with 'global'

Webpack process/browser on the last vue3 branch on sat (stashed) wasnt working, switched to vite
Vite configurations 
	important: optimizeDeps, using commonjs plugin to patch import of commonjs modules
	went down path of babel config, required to be passed thru via a vite babel plugin this is because vite already comes with its own thing that does most of what babel does
have to change syntax from common-form-component
update packages, first thing is upgrade vue and use vue-compat build - trying to get it to run is difficult because of imcompatibility 

next step: migrate tests

set of links to follow

Discovery process:
problems: i manually went to the dist folder for common form compoentns thsoe problem compoentns that cannot be imported i added the extensnion and then it works, i think the extensions part is not handled by vite (a time when alias was not put in the correct spot, tested by adding alias manually in the dist folder and it works), adding resolve aliases under correct place to work

`build` is an optional property that allows you to provide your own custom build function to the Vite build process. This function takes the same options as `buildOptions` and the default build function and should return the same result. This property is mainly used when you need to implement custom build logic or when you need to use a different build tool that's not supported by Vite out of the box.

In summary, `buildOptions` and `build` serve different purposes but both can be used to customize the build process in a Vite project.
![[Pasted image 20230202114718.png]]
THAT IS WHY
![[Pasted image 20230202114823.png]]
The `buildOptions` option in Vite only affects the behavior of the `build` command, which creates a static version of your application for production deployment. If you run the development server with the `vite dev` command, the `buildOptions` configuration will not be in effect. It is only applied when you run the `vite build` command.
Duplicating the same configuration in both `build` and `buildOptions` could lead to unexpected results and it's recommended to only have the configuration in either one of them. If the configuration is already present in the `build` section, there's no need to duplicate it in the `buildOptions` section.

i was running vite serve while having my module resolve aliases over at build which was why it wasn't working, design system require addition of @ alias to support importing of the font files which are in sat form itself. if using babel requrie module-resolve package. (wondering if )
i have got the invalid way to specify moduleresolution it seems.

next plugin required is commonjs, coming from lodash, braintree-web, which does not have esm build, default export or named export not supported, need to look at source from the browser to figure out how to import. which is using * for the brain-tree helper.

The `extensions` property that you set in `rollupOptions` is specific to Rollup, and is used by Rollup to resolve file extensions when building your project. The `resolveFileExtensions` property, on the other hand, is specific to Vite and is used by Vite to resolve file extensions when serving your project in development mode.

When you use Vite, it internally uses Rollup to build your project, so both the `rollupOptions` and the `esm.resolveFileExtensions` properties are used.

The `resolveFileExtensions` property is used by Vite in development mode to resolve file extensions when serving your project. This allows you to import files without specifying their file extension, as long as their extension is included in the `resolveFileExtensions` array.

The `extensions` property in `rollupOptions` is used by Rollup during the build process to resolve file extensions when creating the final build output. This allows Rollup to properly understand and process the different types of files in your project, such as `.js` and `.vue` files.

So, to answer your question, both the `resolveFileExtensions` and `extensions` properties are used by Vite, but they serve different purposes. The `resolveFileExtensions` property is used in development mode, while the `extensions` property is used during the build process.

next roadblock: using babel config, keep coming up with jsxparser errors
In Vite, the `alias` property should be defined under the `rollupOptions` object within your Vite configuration.
---
Yes, if you are missing the `resolveFileExtensions` property under the `esm` object in your Vite configuration, you may encounter issues with file extension resolution when running `vite serve`.

The `resolveFileExtensions` property determines the file extensions that Vite will attempt to resolve when you import a module. If this property is not set, Vite may not be able to correctly resolve the file extensions of your imported modules, causing errors when building and serving your project.

mayb i should separately compile it on form-components first as esm before i use it in sat form
- this is to solve braintree-web issues
on form-components i need to migrate the webpack settings to webpack 5
https://futurestud.io/tutorials/how-to-fix-webpack-merge-is-not-a-function
came across this issue, and also came across setImmeidate no logner valid

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64944796/webpack-5-and-esm/70871110#70871110
this is how to configure webpack to compile to esm

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50805384/module-not-found-error-cant-resolve-vue-path-not-correct

see answer here how to configure vue3 and webpack 5
i also overrode webpack to use 5 everywhere

i saw for real npm bugging out keep installing but my form-configs for example doesnt install everything on its package.json dependencies,
to replciate look at node_modules of common-form-component on ym vue3 branch npm i,
despite deleting node_modules and package-lock repeatedly and running npm install again, not there the dependencies

i didnt have babel as a dependency
seems i have confirmed babel is nto being applied for .vue file, should have looked at the documentation for vite babel plugin more


@vue/babel-preset-app is onyl meant to be used if using vue/cli

// dont know if should keep such dependencies
npm i -D @vue/babel-preset-jsx
npm install @vue/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx --save-dev
npm install @vue/babel-helper-vue-jsx-merge-props --save
then cannto find so install
Cannot find module 'babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx'
Cannot find module 'babel-plugin-syntax-jsx'

still donthave vue edit hmr, which is bad, just now saw a plugin meant for that? 0 will check once i can build

i think these are useless
    // esm: {
    //   resolveFileExtensions: ['.js', '.vue']
    // },
    // transform: 'babel', 

i cannot use yalc, apparently if use it a preprocess before commonjs isnt actiavated so commonjs says my common-form-component stuff have syntax errors

upgrade these packages
https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/migration/breaking.html
vuex4 ( maybe not much just double check )
vue-router4

webpack-vue3 is misleading it is currently where i do my vite config
