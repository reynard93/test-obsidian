we call respository apis/services

the form (the public contract of my repository) is independent from the data src (data src can come from many places)

the purpose of a repository is to produce and store entities
a json is almost always an entity, id 

example: business rules on what is required for promotion
	1: avg votes should be > 7
	2: require min 4 votes
